The most widely used open source data management tools are relational databases such as
MySQL and PostgreSQL; NoSQL databases such as MongoDB Apache CouchDB, and Apache Cassandra;
and file-based tools such as the Hadoop File System or Cloud File systems like Ceph.
Finally,Elasticsearch is mainly used for storing text data and creating a search index for
fast document retrieval.

Here are the most widely used open source data integration and transformation tools:
Apache AirFlow, originally created by AirBNB; KubeFlow, which enables you to execute data
science pipelines on top of Kubernetes; Apache Kafka, which originated from LinkedIn;
Apache Nifi, which delivers a very nice visual editor;
Apache SparkSQL (which enables you to use ANSI SQL and scales up to compute clusters
of 1000s of nodes), and NodeRED, which also provides a visual editor.
NodeRED consumes so little in resources that it even runs on small devices like a Raspberry
Pi.
Weâ€™ll now introduce the most widely used open source data visualization tools.
We have to distinguish between programming libraries where you need to use code and tools
that contain a user interface.
The most popular libraries are covered in the next videos.
A similar approach uses Hue, which can create visualizations from SQL queries.
Kibana, a data exploration and visualization web application, is limited to Elasticsearch
(the data provider).
Finally, Apache Superset is a data exploration and visualization web application.
